# Unpluggd
The Unpluggd is a device which encourages users to put away their phones for a while in the 'phone jail'. Two users compete by placing their 
phones in separate compartments and using accompanying switches to lock the doors. Separate timers begin for each user and count up until they need to take
their phone back when another button press will open the gates and free it.

# Motivation
HackGT 2022 encouraged participants to make a 'retro hack' and when our group struggled to come up with an idea, at times becoming destracted by our 
cellphones, the idea for the Unpluggd was born.

#Technology
Our group used an arduino uno, two servo motors, a liquid crystal display and a number of other circuit components to realize the Unpluggd.
The C++ code used to control the arduino is in the other file in this repository.
